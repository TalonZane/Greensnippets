# Greensnippets
A collection of the more code-heavy/gimmicky things I've written for PPG mods.

Credit is not required, but appreciated.

As brutal and inhumane as this game is, it holds a very warming grasp on my heart. I was in a bad place in life when I found it and I ended up learning C# from it, which is probably one of my favorite activities now. I could have never expected a community to form around a reskinned brick, since I mainly only started writing these mods to let myself learn. A lot of times I'd create something cool, and just not feel like fleshing it out at all (which is what this page is to share).

I hope everyone supports my decison to move on and begin work on possible games in the future, and I hope I've inspired someone to pick up C# or programming in general.

Make me proud! -TZ
